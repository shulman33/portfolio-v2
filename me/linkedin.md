Sam Shulman
Enterprise Architect at Healthfirst | I build things that make people’s
lives easier
United States
Summary
I'm an Enterprise Architect at Healthfirst, where I design AWS-based
systems for healthcare data exchange - event-driven pipelines, FHIR
APIs, the kind of infrastructure that moves terabytes of patient data
for federal compliance without anyone noticing.
Day to day, that means a lot of AWS Step Functions, serverless
architecture, and figuring out how to make healthcare systems
actually talk to each other.
I can't stop building things on the side. Right now I'm working on
MarketLinter, a market validation tool that orchestrates multiple LLMs
to help indie devs validate startup ideas, and ResumeForge, which
parses resumes into structured data and generates ATS-optimized
versions for specific job postings. I also have an AI chatbot that
talks to recruiters for me (you might be chatting with it) and a course
registration system I built in college that 50% of the student body
ended up using.
I want to work somewhere I can learn from engineers who are better
than me and ship things that people actually use. Startups interest
me because I like seeing what I build hit production fast.
When I'm not coding, I'm a Jets, Yankees, and Knicks fan. Yes, I
know how to handle disappointment.
Open to connecting about architecture, healthcare tech, or
interesting opportunities.
