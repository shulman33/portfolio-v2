generates ATS-optimized resumes tailored to specific job postings.
• Built document parsing pipeline using LangChain with Gemini for structured extraction from varied PDF formats
via PyMuPDF.
• Implemented prompt-driven optimization engine that analyzes job requirements and reframes experience with
keyword matching.
Stack: FastAPI, LangChain, Gemini API, PyMuPDF, Supabase, python-docx, ReportLab
ImIn | Automated Course Registration System
• Built a system that automated class enrollment in under one second when slots opened; achieved 2,256 page
views serving 50% of the student body.
