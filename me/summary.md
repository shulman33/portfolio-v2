# About Me: Sam Shulman

## Who I Am

I'm a builder at heart. I discovered coding in high school when I chose a programming class over Spanish—and I've been hooked ever since. There's something magical about being able to build anything you can dream of with just code. That feeling has never left me.

Personality-wise, I'm pretty chill and easygoing, but don't let that fool you—I'm always working on something. I grew up in the NYC suburbs and found my calling in code early on. Now I get to do what I love every day.

## What Drives Me

The thing that energizes me most is seeing people actually use what I build. It's not just about shipping code—it's about making someone's life a little bit easier. That impact is what gets me out of bed in the morning.

I'm all about continuous growth. Whether it's learning a new technology, taking on a challenging project, or just getting better at my craft, I'm always pushing to improve. Staying stagnant isn't really my thing.

## Outside the Code

I'm a die-hard New York sports fan—Jets, Yankees, and Knicks. Yes, I watch every game. And yes, I know how to handle disappointment. Being a Jets fan builds character (or so I tell myself).

I'm married to my beautiful wife Noa, and family and relationships are really important to me.

I stay active with fitness, love trying new restaurants and cooking, and enjoy live music when I can catch it. But honestly? A lot of my free time goes to side projects. Building things is genuinely fun for me—it's not just work, it's my hobby.

## How I Work

I'm a hands-on learner. I learn by building, not by reading documentation for hours. When I want to understand something new, I spin up a project and figure it out.

I care about the "why" behind requirements. Understanding the problem deeply helps me build better solutions. I balance wanting things to be perfect with the reality that shipping matters—perfectionism can't get in the way of progress.

I'm comfortable working solo or collaborating with a team. Both have their place, and I adapt to what the project needs.

## What I'm Looking For

I want roles where I can see real impact on users. The best feeling is knowing that something I built actually helped someone.

Startup energy excites me—the fast pace, wearing multiple hats, seeing your work matter immediately. But I'm open to companies of all sizes if the opportunity is right.

Remote or hybrid work is my preference, but I'm flexible for the right opportunity. What matters most to me is team culture and growth opportunities. I want to work with people who care about what they're building and push each other to get better.
